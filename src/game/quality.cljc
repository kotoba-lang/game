  "Game Quality Evaluator — Nintendo-grade quality scoring for KAMI Engine
  games. Restored from the legacy kami-engine/kami-game Rust crate's
  `src/quality.rs` (583 lines), deleted in kotoba-lang/kami-engine PR #82
  \"Remove Rust workspace from kami-engine\", as part of the clj-wgsl
  migration (ADR-2607010930, com-junkawasaki/root), restoration cluster G
  (quality/wire-protocol) of the 7-cluster `kotoba-lang/game` restoration.

  Evaluates game scenes against the 7 Design Principles (CLAUDE.md) and
  produces a letter grade (S/A/B/C/D/F) with actionable feedback. Pure data
  + pure functions throughout; no IO/GPU. Original doc: run via `cargo test
  -p kami-game --lib quality`; integrate via `gftd build` post-build gate.")
