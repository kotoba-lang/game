  "Tests ported 1:1 from kami-game's `island_gen.rs` `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`
  (kotoba-lang/kami-engine, deleted PR #82). See `game.island-gen` docstring.

  Two adaptations from the Rust originals (both noted inline below):
    - No `serde_json` round-trip: this zero-dep port operates on the plain
      EDN scene map directly (the map itself is the portable form).
    - `all_28_games_generate_valid_islands` expected 28 islands, but the
      actual catalog (as ported faithfully in `game.island-gen`) has 29
      entries (22 originals + 6 brainrot + 1 chase game, `ketsu-gorilla`,
      added after that assertion was written). This port asserts the
      correct count, 29."
